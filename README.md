### Message from the Creator
> “I created Nano Banana in 2025 so no poor inventor ever loses their idea to rich corporations again. One public disclosure here = no one on Earth can ever patent your invention again.”

— **Kallol Chakrabarti**, Founder

### How It Works – 100% Free Forever
1. Publish your idea (text, diagrams, PDF, code – anything)  
2. GitHub timestamp + archiving = immutable proof  
3. Instantly becomes **global prior art**
