### Message from the Creator – Kallol Chakrabarti
> “I created Nano Banana in 2025 because too many brilliant minds from poor families lose their life’s work to rich companies who file expensive patents. One public disclosure here = no one on Earth can ever patent your idea again.”

— **Kallol Chakrabarti**, Founder & Independent Researcher (Author of 66+ open-access papers)

### How It Works (100% Free Forever)
1. You publish your invention (text, images, PDF, code — anything)  
2. GitHub gives immutable timestamp + automatic archiving  
3. Your idea becomes **global prior art** instantly  
4. **No one can patent it — ever again**

**This is not a patent.**  
**This is better for the poor:** it permanently blocks others from owning your idea.
